# Cancel or not? Predictive Analysis for Hotel Booking Data
## 1 Background
A large number of reservation orders are generated every day on the hotel reservation website, and there are significant differences in the reservation time, reservation location, and number of customers for different orders. 

In a large number of orders generated every day, after a part of the order is completed, the end user will not finalize the order and will cancel the order in the middle. This research is mainly to predict the behavior of canceling orders.

**Research purpose**: Through the multi-dimensional information of the order, predict whether different orders will be cancelled.

**Research significance**: Before the user cancels the order, it is predicted whether the user will cancel the order, which is beneficial to the hotel and the reservation website to better allocate resources, improve the true utilization rate of resources, and maximize the revenue.
